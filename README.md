This repository contains the three required submission files for the PH125.9x capstone unit choose your own project assignment, namely:

"McRae_choose_own_project.Rmd" - a report in the form of an Rmd file, "McRae_choose_own_project.pdf" - a report in the form of a PDF document knit from the Rmd file, "McRae_choose_own_project.R" - an R script that generates the analysis.

Data files are provided in the sub-folder data/ and are referenced in the Rmd and script files using relative file paths.

The files are shared here for the purpose of peer grading and staff grading.
